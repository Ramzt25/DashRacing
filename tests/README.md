## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Backend not starting:**
```bash
cd C:\DashRacing
npm run dev
```

**WebSocket connection failures:**
- Check if port 3001 is available
- Verify WebSocket server is running with backend

**Database connection issues:**
```bash
cd C:\DashRacing
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

**Test dependencies missing:**
```bash
cd C:\DashRacing\tests
npm install
```

### Test Environment Reset
If tests are failing due to data conflicts:
```bash
cd C:\DashRacing
npx prisma db push --force-reset
npm run seed  # if you have seed data
```

## Continuous Integration

This test suite is designed to be run:
- **Before every deployment** to production
- **After major feature additions** to validate system integrity
- **During performance optimization** to ensure no regressions
- **As part of CI/CD pipeline** for automated validation

## Architecture Validation

The comprehensive test suite validates the complete DASH Racing Platform architecture:

```
Frontend (React Native/Expo)
    ‚Üï (API calls, WebSocket)
Backend API (Node.js/Fastify)
    ‚Üï (Database queries)
Database (SQLite/Prisma)
    ‚Üï (Real-time sync)
WebSocket Server (Live features)
    ‚Üï (External APIs)
External Services (Google Maps, AI APIs)
```

Every connection, every API endpoint, every real-time feature, and every data flow is thoroughly tested to ensure the entire system works flawlessly as an integrated platform.
