## üîç Detailed Error Analysis

### Primary Issues Identified

1. **Critical Infrastructure Problem**
   - **Issue**: Backend services not running
   - **Impact**: Prevents all API testing
   - **Solution**: Start backend server on port 4000
   - **Priority**: CRITICAL

2. **Security Test Compilation Error**
   - **Issue**: TypeScript error - missing `toBeOneOf` matcher
   - **Impact**: Security tests cannot execute
   - **Solution**: Fix Jest configuration or replace with standard matchers
   - **Priority**: HIGH

3. **Connection Failures**
   - **Issue**: AggregateError in all API calls
   - **Impact**: All endpoint tests fail immediately
   - **Solution**: Ensure backend is running and accessible
   - **Priority**: CRITICAL

## üéØ Roadmap to 100% Functionality

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Critical)
- [ ] Start backend server on port 4000
- [ ] Verify health endpoint responds
- [ ] Confirm database connectivity
- [ ] Check WebSocket server on port 3001

### Phase 2: Test Environment Fixes (High Priority)
- [ ] Fix security test TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] Update Jest configuration for custom matchers
- [ ] Verify all test dependencies are properly installed
- [ ] Ensure test database is seeded

### Phase 3: API Functionality Validation (High Priority)
- [ ] Test all 18 API endpoints individually
- [ ] Validate authentication flows
- [ ] Confirm CRUD operations work
- [ ] Test real-time features (WebSocket)

### Phase 4: Performance & Security Validation (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Execute load testing with 100+ concurrent requests
- [ ] Validate response times (<500ms target)
- [ ] Run security vulnerability scans
- [ ] Test input validation and sanitization
