# 🎯 GridGhost Incremental Development Guide

## Quick Start

1. **Test Current Phase**: Run `./test-minimal-app.ps1`
2. **Check Status**: Review `INCREMENTAL_BUILD_STATUS.md` 
3. **Fix Issues**: Before moving to next step
4. **Update Status**: Mark completed steps ✅

## 📁 Project Structure

```
DashRacing/
├── mobile/                    # Original complex app (reference only)
├── mobile-minimal/            # 🎯 Our working minimal app
├── INCREMENTAL_BUILD_STATUS.md  # 📋 Progress tracking
├── test-minimal-app.ps1       # 🧪 Phase 1.1 test script
└── test-phase-X.ps1           # 🧪 Future phase test scripts
```

## 🚀 Current Workflow

### Phase 1.1: Basic App Structure ⏳
**Goal**: Get a minimal React Native app with navigation running

**What we built**:
- ✅ Minimal package.json (only essential deps)
- ✅ Basic App.tsx with bottom tab navigation  
- ✅ Two simple screens (Home, Profile)
- ✅ Android configuration (simplified)
- ✅ TypeScript setup

**Test Command**: `./test-minimal-app.ps1`

**If this works**:
1. Update status file ✅
2. Commit changes
3. Move to Phase 1.2 (styling)

**If this fails**:
1. Document error in status file
2. Fix the specific issue
3. Test again before proceeding

## 🔄 Development Rules

### ✅ DO:
- Fix each step completely before moving to next
- Keep each phase simple and focused
- Test after every change
- Document issues immediately
- Commit working states frequently

### ❌ DON'T:
- Add complex features early
- Skip testing phases
- Try to fix multiple issues at once
- Move to next phase with broken current phase

## 🛠️ Useful Commands

```bash
# Test current phase
./test-minimal-app.ps1

# Quick build check
cd mobile-minimal
npm run android

# Clean everything
cd mobile-minimal
npm run clean
cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..

# Check what's installed
npm list --depth=0

# Install missing package
npm install package-name
```

## 📋 Phase Overview

1. **Phase 1**: Foundation (navigation, basic structure)
2. **Phase 2**: Core Navigation (all screens)  
3. **Phase 3**: Basic UI Components
4. **Phase 4**: Configuration & Environment
5. **Phase 5**: API Foundation
6. **Phase 6**: Authentication
7. **Phase 7**: Core Features (one by one)
8. **Phase 8**: Advanced Features

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Run `./test-minimal-app.ps1`
2. If successful ✅, create Phase 1.2 (styling)
3. If failed ❌, debug and fix before proceeding

## 💡 Tips

- **Small Steps**: Each phase should take 15-30 minutes max
- **Test Early**: Don't wait until the end to test
- **Document Everything**: Both successes and failures
- **Stay Focused**: Resist adding "just one more feature"

**Remember**: The goal is to have a working app at every step, not to build everything at once! 🚀
