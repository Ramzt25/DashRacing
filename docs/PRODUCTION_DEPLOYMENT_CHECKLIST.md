azd env set GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY "your-google-maps-key"
azd env set AZURE_MAPS_API_KEY "your-azure-maps-key"
azd env set DATABASE_ADMIN_PASSWORD "your-secure-database-password"
```

### 3. Validate Infrastructure
```bash
# Preview deployment without making changes
azd provision --preview

# Check for any validation errors
```

### 4. Deploy to Azure
```bash
# Deploy infrastructure and applications
azd up

# Monitor deployment progress
azd logs
```

### 5. Post-Deployment Verification
```bash
# Check application health
azd show

# Test API endpoints
curl https://your-api-url.azurecontainerapps.io/health
